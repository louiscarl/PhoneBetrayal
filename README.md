# Betrayal - Phone-based Party game

## How To Play:
Get a group of friends together and have each player go to http://louiscarl.github.io/betrayal/ on their phone.
When the round starts, each player will be given a role. Based on your role, choose a target that you think will make you most likely to succeed. Be quick, these actions happen in real time and you might be killed.
After the round time limit is up, each player who succeeded in their role will be given a point.
Play until (at least) one player reaches the score limit.
